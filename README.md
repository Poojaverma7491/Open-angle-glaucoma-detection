I successfully created a system in our project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify openangle glaucoma in retinal fundus images. When compared to conventional diagnostic methods, our model showed notable gains in efficiency and accuracy, underscoring the potential of deep learning for automating the identification of glaucoma. We removed the requirement for manual feature engineering by utilising CNN's capacity to automatically extract pertinent features, which increased the adaptability and scalability of our system. Our model's performance and generalisability were further improved by crucial strategies such data augmentation, dropout regularisation, and transfer learning, which produced encouraging outcomes on our test dataset. The basis for incorporating AI-powered technologies into clinical settings is laid by this initiative, which could help ophthalmologists with early diagnosis and intervention. Even though our model performed well, there is still room for development. Some of these areas include expanding the dataset, adding multimodal data (such OCT scans), and making the model's decision-making process easier to understand. All things considered, this experiment shows that CNN-based glaucoma detection methods are feasible and offers a path forward for further research focused on enhancing clinical integration and diagnostic precision.
